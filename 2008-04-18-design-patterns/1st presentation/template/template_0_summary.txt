the players:
  an abstract class, inherited from by
  a number of concrete subclasses
  
a parent class defines abstract behavior for its subclasses, which must define the concrete behavior.

usually the parent is an abstract class 

(ruby does not seem to let us define a traditional abstract class)

the magic of the template pattern is really the template method!

non abstract methods can be used as hooks, not required to be overridden

an inheritance based pattern! variations are anticipated and built into subclasses

examples include:
  report generation
  the initialize method on new objects
