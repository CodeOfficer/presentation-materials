what is ujs?
	a movement
	js is maturing
	it used to be browser compatability, now its feature compatability
	libraries are advanced enough to handle bowser compatability for us

re: js specifically ...
	no inline event handlers
	all code is in external files
	site is useable without js
	existing links and forms are repurposed
	js dependant elements are dynamically added to the page

how do you use ujs?
	dont make assumptions, degrade nicely, progressive enhancement
		build a site that works without js
	use hooks and dom relationships
	use css instead of dom traversal
	blah blah

- show bad inline js : why is this bad?
		we'd like to seperate concerns
		dom = structure
		js  = behavior
		css = presentation

		Begin with your content,
		give it structure with semantically descriptive markup,
		apply a presentation layer using CSS, and finally,
		add a behavior layer with DOM Scripting.

- show good ujs
		*come up with an example showing why unobtrusive js is better?*

how do you create dynamic behaviors when all your js is in a static file? (data-attributes)
